If you're someone like me and like to host various services, you might also want
to have your own personal website. There are many approaches to this, for
example you could use a <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> like
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org) or [ghost](https://ghost.org), you could use
a static site generator like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (that's what GitHub
Pages use) or you could program your own site if you want.

I've tried a bit of all of them, but it never really worked for me. Eventually I
landed on Jekyll, so this is also where you're reading this on now. To be honest,
I don't have too much expertise on the topic, but I made it work, and a Blog
needs posts.

## Pros and Cons of Jekyll

### Dead Simple

Usage of Jekyll is really easy in my opinion. You kind of just write markdown
files and add some front matter. That is if you're using a pre-made template
of course, you can make it as complicated as you want, just note that Jekyll
generates static sites, so no fancy server side computation.

### A lot of modern themes

There are a lot of modern and good-looking themes for Jekyll. At the time this
post is written, cscherr.de uses [chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

A large collection of Jekyll themes can be found
[here](http://jekyllthemes.org/) (note: this site does not use HTTPS for
some reason).

### Multilingual sucks

With the chirpy theme at least, I couldn't get Multilingual content to work
without going into the rabbit hole. You can select from a good amount of main
languages, but you cannot have multiple versions of your website for various
languages in a single project.
