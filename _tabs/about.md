This is the personal website and blog if *Christoph J. Scherr*.

## Professionally

I am currently a student of Cybersecurity at [DHBW Mannheim](https://www.mannheim.dhbw.de/) and work at
[NewTec](https://www.newtec.de). Computer Technology, especially with a focus on
security is my passion.

## Technology

I like managing and administering servers and services. This website is hosted
on a [VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) hosted in
Germany, which I pay [Netcup](https://www.netcup.de) for. Hosting your own services
and managing your own servers is fun and I regularly learn new computer related
things from it.

I like Open Source Software, working on my own projects and using mostly OSS on
my devices where possible. All my servers run [Debian](https://www.debian.org),
and I use GNU/Linux on my PCs too.

I mainly program in [Rust](https://rustlang.org) at the time of writing this,
but I know many programming languages.

## Other Interests

I've been learning Japanese for over a year by now. I find myself often
stumbling over Japanese media, and I've built a liking to the language by now.
My Japanese is still pretty bad, and I still struggle to understand basic sentences,
but I'm constantly learning.

When I feel creative, I sometimes make music. Some of that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/@plexsheep1296).
